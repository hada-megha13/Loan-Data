## Prosper-Loans-Data Analysis

This project has been done on the data set from Prosper(provided by Udacity).

This data set contains data for 113,937 loans with 81 variables correspondong to each loan entry. For the purpose of analysis, some variables namely 'ListingNumber', 'ListingCreationDate', 'IsBorrowerHomeowner','Term', 'LoanStatus', 'ClosedDate', 'BorrowerAPR', 'BorrowerRate','ProsperRating (Alpha)','BorrowerState','Occupation','DebtToIncomeRatio', 'IncomeRange','LoanOriginalAmount','LoanOriginationDate', 'LoanOriginationQuarter','Investors' have been taken into consideration.

The primary objective of this project is to analyse the different variables that can impact the loan status. Also, to get some quantifiable insights by performing univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis that could describe relationships among multiple variables using statistics and data visualizations.

Varied plots like bar plot, box plot, line chart etc have been used depending on the type of variable to be analysed in the exploratory data analysis.
